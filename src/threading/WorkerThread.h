/**
 * The class derived from QThread that allows for user-defined actions
 * when the thread finished its execution. This is useful, for instance, to update
 * GUI, or show the user the results of the computation, etc.
 *
 * The programmer will usually want to override run() method for the work performed
 * by the thread and done() method for the actions performed by main thread
 * when the work is done.
 *
 * It is the programmer responsibility to delete the object unless deleteWhenDone
 * constructor parameter is set to true. In that case, the object is automatically
 * deleted after done() method is executed.
